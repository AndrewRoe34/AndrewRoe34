## AGILE Planner

Solves the perpetual problem of creating a work schedule that is both dynamic in nature but intelligent enough to be actually functional:
*	Designed and developed a highly adaptable scheduling system, accommodating diverse scheduling requirements.
*	Integrated and designed my own custom functional and object-oriented scripting languages for flexible user interaction and customization within the Agile Planner.
*	Implemented an extensive logging mechanism to record system actions, enhancing transparency and facilitating debugging.
*	Employed Java binary serialization for efficient storage and retrieval of scheduling data, optimizing system performance.

## CLRS Solutions

I'm currently working on the solution set for *Introduction to Algorithms*. It's a great way to refine algorithmic thinking as well as expanding knowledge. While I'm currently tackling this project solo at the moment, feel free to make contributions or edits if interested :)
