## fprintf(stdout, "Welcome!");

Hey there! My name is Andrew Roe and I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science from NC State University. I'm experienced in Object Oriented Analysis & Design, Data Structures & Algorithms, Java, JavaFX, C, and MySQL.

## AGILE Planner

Adopting the principles of Object Oriented Analysis & Design as well as Algorithm analysis, I am currently developing a full-fledge system that handles schedule generation for the everday user:
* Autogenerate an entire work schedule from various tasks, events, and appointments
* Select one of two in-house scheduling options for either distributive or crammed workweeks
* Customizeable tasks for greater flexibility
* Modifiable work week for increased control
* Automated day tracker to ensure you meet your week's goals
* Exportable schedule to Google Calendar for seamless integration
* Local log of all events and errors reported by system
* Cross-platform compatability

## AGILE Minecraft Seeder UI

After seeing a request to develop a desktop application that would provide a GUI for a Minecraft Seeder, which was only a C executable on Linux, I took up the challenge to create a cleaner interface:
* Wraps a C executable under a Linux environment via Java to provide a proper UI
* Utilizes JavaFx for an improved look and feel 
* Stores a log of all recently generated seeds
* Maintains a record of all favorited seeds from recent history
