## CLRS Solutions

I'm currently working on the solution set for *Introduction to Algorithms*. It's a great way to refine algorithmic thinking as well as expanding knowledge. While I'm currently tackling this project solo at the moment, feel free to make contributions or edits if interested :)

## AGILE Planner

Solves the perpetual problem of creating a work schedule that is both dynamic in nature but intelligent enough to be actually functional:
* Autogenerate an entire work schedule via each task's time duration and due date proximity
* Balances all tasks intelligently with a distributive mindset
* Customizeable tasks for greater flexibility (along with schedule regeneration)
* Local log of all events and errors reported by system
