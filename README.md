## fprintf(stdout, "Welcome!");

Hey there! My name is Andrew Roe and I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science from NC State University. I'm experienced in Object Oriented Analysis & Design, Data Structures & Algorithms, Java, C, and MySQL.

## AGILE Planner

Adopting the principles of Object Oriented Analysis & Design as well as Algorithm analysis, I am currently developing a full-fledge system that handles schedule generation for the everday user:
* Autogenerate an entire work schedule from various tasks and their specs
* Balances all tasks intelligently with a distributive mindset
* Customizeable tasks for greater flexibility (along with schedule regeneration)
* Modifiable work week for increased control
* Automated day tracker to ensure you meet your week's goals
* Exportable schedule to Google Calendar for seamless integration
* Local log of all events and errors reported by system
