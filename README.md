Hey there! My name is Andrew Roe and I'm currently pursuing a degree in IT with a minor Computer Science. I'm a former Teaching Assistant for Data Structures & Algorithms along with Analytics. Here's what I've been working on:

## QuickSched

QuickSched is a robust, dynamic scheduling platform that is closely configured with user settings to provide flexible schedules that cater toward your specific needs. Here's a list of features it has to offer:
* Pure command line interface for working with the platform.
*	Dynamic scheduling closely linked with user config options to generate fully customizable schedules & timetables.
*	Customize your weekly hours to be as flexible as you like (0 hours on Sunday, 6 on Wednesday, 2 on Friday).
*	Configure your time preferences for work, whether to work overtime, and the minimum hours to break up a task for a day.
*	Export scheduling data to Google Calendar.
*	Create/Edit/Delete Tasks, Events, and Cards as needed.
*	Color code your Tasks with Cards (which serve the role of both labelling and coloring).
*	Setup Events to be either individual or recurring time blocks throughout the week.
*	Display all upcoming subtasks scheduled for the week (along with Tasks, Cards, and Events).
*	Generate a full-detailed report on all your scheduling data
*	Easily modifiable (and transferable) serialization file for preserving all your scheduling data (uses an intelligent pointer system to link data together).
*	Intelligent parser that allows flexible arrangement of arguments and sloppy timestamp expressions (e.g. “10:-1:pm” translates to “10:00am-1:00pm”).
*	Wide array of abbreviations for date expressions (e.g. “mon”, “tmrw”, “eow”).
*	Tasks are timetabled at “clean” parts of the hour (to be specific, QuickSched will locate the nearest quarter hour for the start of an interval for a Task).

## CLRS Solutions

I'm currently working on the solution set for *Introduction to Algorithms*. It's a great way to refine algorithmic thinking as well as expanding knowledge. While I'm currently tackling this project solo at the moment, feel free to make contributions or edits if interested :)

## *Standardized Approach to Solving Coding Problems*

A brief technical writeup that explains how to approach any coding problem that one might encounter in the technical interview
